# 2022_Computer_Architecture
[NCKU computer architecture](http://wiki.csie.ncku.edu.tw/arch/schedule)
Thanks [jserv](https://github.com/jserv) who is the professor of this course teach me a lot, and I have learned and growed very much.

## HW01

### Introduce

I will pick a [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/three-consecutive-odds/) question, and after implementing it, I will convert it into risc-V assembly language and use [Ripes](https://github.com/mortbopet/Ripes) to analyze the pipeline and discuss the three kinds of hazard.

## Hw02

### Introduce

In this assignment, we will learn how to use [riscv-none-elf-gcc toolchain](https://xpack.github.io/riscv-none-elf-gcc/) and write risc-v assembly code which can run on the professor's [rv32emu](https://github.com/sysprog21/rv32emu), and finally learn various methods of compiler optimization.
